      <description>&amp;ldquo;Hey Mycroft, we&amp;rsquo;ve got a Problem&amp;rdquo; Introduction During my journey contributing to open source I was working with my friend Matteo De Carlo on an AUR Package of a really interesting project called Mycroft AI. It&amp;rsquo;s an AI-powered vocal assistant started with a crowdfunding campaign in 2015 and a more recent one that allowed Mycroft to produce their Mark-I and Mark-II devices. It&amp;rsquo;s also running on Linux Desktop/Server, Raspberry PI and will be available soonâ„¢ on Jaguar F-Type and Land Rover</description>

      <description>We all love Markdown, right? It&amp;rsquo;s a fast and user-friendly way to beautify our documentation. Well, all that glitters is not gold, in this case not for system administrators.
Some time ago playing the Hack.lu 2017 CTF event with my team we solved an interesting challenge called Mitsune were a misconfigured instance of mitsune was given and we had to send a malicious link containing an XSS payload to an administrator to steal their cookies.</description>
